# Project Title: Stock Analysis with Tata Motors Data

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the stock data of Tata Motors using historical stock prices and trading volume information. The analysis will involve exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, time series analysis, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling to derive insights and make informed decisions.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from the 'Tata Motors.csv' file. The dataset contains information on stock prices, including the opening, high, low, closing, and volume of trades for different dates.

## Analysis Approaches
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Perform a comprehensive EDA to understand the distribution of stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant metrics over time.
   - Visualize the trends and patterns in the stock data using line plots, histograms, and other relevant visualizations.
2. Statistical Analysis
   - Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles for the stock price and trading volume data.
   - Identify any outliers or anomalies in the data that may require further investigation.
3. Time Series Analysis
   - Apply time series analysis techniques to identify seasonality, trends, and other patterns in the stock price data.
   - Use methods such as moving averages, exponential smoothing, and autocorrelation analysis to gain insights into the stock price movements.
4. Correlation Analysis
   - Explore the correlation between different stock metrics such as open, high, low, and close prices.
   - Investigate the relationship between trading volume and stock price movements.
5. Predictive Modeling
   - Build predictive models to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
   - Evaluate the performance of the models and assess their predictive accuracy.
6. Financial Indicators
   - Calculate financial indicators such as VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), 52-week high/low, and other relevant metrics to gain insights into the stock performance.

## Conclusion
Upon completion of the analysis, the project will provide actionable insights and potential strategies for leveraging the stock data of Tata Motors.
